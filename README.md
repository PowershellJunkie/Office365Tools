# Office365Tools
This repository is for all of my Powershell Office 365 tools. If you like them, great! If not and I suck, thanks for stopping by!
Also, you may notice I don't do the typical <# .Synopsis, .Purpose, .General-Self-Wanking #> that other Powershell guys do. 
And, more importantly, I never will.
Here's my view: 
Should code be commented? 
Yes! Absolutely!
Should you use the comments of your code to jerk yourself off and clutter up the purpose of the code in the first place?
No.
If you have to pat yourself on the back inside your code, you objectively suck.
Seriously.
Should you use the comments of your code as if you're instructing a monkey on how not to be a monkey any longer?
Yes.
Should you over complicate everything up to and including your instructions?
No. 
And, further, if you are among the many who insist on doing this. Stop it.
No, seriously: 
STOP. 
IT.
Clean code.
Clean comments.
Code that works.
Comments that help.
Balanced Life.
